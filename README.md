Demo built on angular 5.x using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
=========

Application currently in beta

## Backend implementation 

1. Based on [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with mocks from [faker](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) (APIs available at `http://localhost:5000/api/`)

2. Run `npm run build` and `npm start` in order to launch the server (`http://localhost:5000`) with the distribution version of the app 

3. The server randomly simulates delays and errors for testing purposes 

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nmp run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `npm run serve`.
